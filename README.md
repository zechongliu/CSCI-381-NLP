# CSCI-381-NLP

How to run

1. to run the file, make sure you installed Python
2. find the path of train-Spring2023preprocessed.txt and testpreprocessed.txt on your computer
3. change the trainingfilepath and testfilepath in preprocessing.py and run it first 
4. after new text file generated, find the path of train-Spring2023preprocessed.txt and testpreprocessed.txt and it should be in the same path
5. copy it to the trainpreprocessedpath and testpreprocessedpath in nlp.py and run it
6. output will print in the end

1 LANGUAGE MODELING
PART I:
(10 points) Do exercise 3.4 from Chapter 3 in the textbook:
https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/3.pdf
PART II:
In this assignment, you will train several language models and will evaluate them on a test
corpus. You can discuss in groups, but the homework is to be completed and submitted
individually. Two files are provided with this assignment:
1. train.txt
2. test.txt
1
Each file is a collection of texts, one sentence per line. train.txt contains about 100,000 sentences from the NewsCrawl corpus. You will use this corpus to train the language models.
The test corpus test.txt is from the same domain and will be used to evaluate the language
models that you trained.
1.1 PRE-PROCESSING
Prior to training, please complete the following pre-processing steps:
1. Pad each sentence in the training and test corpora with start and end symbols (you can
use <s> and </s>, respectively).
2. Lowercase all words in the training and test corpora. Note that the data already has
been tokenized (i.e. the punctuation has been split off words).
3. Replace all words occurring in the training data once with the token <unk>. Every word
in the test data not seen in training should be treated as <unk>.
1.2 TRAINING THE MODELS
Please use train.txt to train the following language models:
1. A unigram maximum likelihood model.
2. A bigram maximum likelihood model.
3. A bigram model with Add-One smoothing.
1.3 QUESTIONS
Please answer the questions below:
1. (5 points) How many word types (unique words) are there in the training corpus? Please include
the end-of-sentence padding symbol </s> and the unknown token <unk>. Do not include the start of sentence padding symbol <s>.
2. (5 points) How many word tokens are there in the training corpus? Do not include the start of
sentence padding symbol <s>.
3. (10 points) What percentage of word tokens and word types in the test corpus did not occur in
training (before you mapped the unknown words to <unk> in training and test data)?
Please include the padding symbol </s> in your calculations. Do not include the start
of sentence padding symbol <s>.
4. (15 points) Now replace singletons in the training data with <unk> symbol and map words (in the
test corpus) not observed in training to <unk>. What percentage of bigrams (bigram
types and bigram tokens) in the test corpus did not occur in training (treat <unk> as a
regular token that has been observed). Please include the padding symbol </s> in your
calculations. Do not include the start of sentence padding symbol <s>.
2
5. (15 points) Compute the log probability of the following sentence under the three models (ignore
capitalization and pad each sentence as described above). Please list all of the parameters required to compute the probabilities and show the complete calculation. Which
of the parameters have zero values under each model? Use log base 2 in your calculations. Map words not observed in the training corpus to the <unk> token.
â€¢ I look forward to hearing your reply .
6. (20 points) Compute the perplexity of the sentence above under each of the models.
7. (20 points) Compute the perplexity of the entire test corpus under each of the models. Discuss the
differences in the results you obtained.
